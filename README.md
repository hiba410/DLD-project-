# ⏱️ Digital Logic Design Projects – Counter & Stopwatch (Multisim)

This repository contains my **Digital Logic Design (DLD) projects** implemented and simulated using **NI Multisim**.  
The projects demonstrate fundamental concepts of **sequential circuits**, including a **Simple Counter** and a **Digital Stopwatch**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
### 1. 🔢 Simple Counter
- A **sequential circuit** that counts numbers in binary/decimal form.  
- Designed using **flip-flops (JK/DTFF)**, logic gates, and clock pulses.  
- Displays output through LEDs or a 7-segment display.  

### 2. ⏱️ Stopwatch
- A **digital stopwatch** designed using counters and control logic.  
- Can **start, stop, and reset** using input switches.  
- Displays elapsed time on **7-segment displays**.  
- Demonstrates the application of counters in real-world timing circuits.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **NI Multisim** – for simulation and circuit design.  
- **Digital Logic Components**:
  - Flip-Flops (JK / D)  
  - Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND)  
  - Clock Signal Generator  
  - 7-Segment Displays  
  - Switches and LEDs  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the design of **sequential circuits**.  
- Implement **counters** and their applications.  
- Apply digital logic design concepts in **practical simulations**.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **Multisim simulation tools**.  

---

## 📊 Results
- ✅ The **counter** successfully counts in sequence based on clock input.  
- ✅ The **stopwatch** can be started, stopped, and reset as required.  
- ✅ Both circuits were simulated and verified in **Multisim**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add support for **up/down counters**.  
- Extend stopwatch to **minutes and hours**.  
- Implement the design on **FPGA/Hardware** using Verilog/VHDL.
